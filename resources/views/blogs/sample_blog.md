### Morning Rush: The First Pour

It’s 7 a.m., and before I even get a chance to stretch my handle, BOOM—hot coffee comes pouring in. No "Good morning," no "How’s your ceramic holding up?" Just scalding liquid and a frantic human muttering, “Why am I awake?”

Do they thank me for holding their life source? No. They spill coffee on the counter and blame ME.

### Afternoon Snooze: The Forgotten Mug

By 2 p.m., I’m abandoned on a desk, half-full of lukewarm sadness. The human’s off doing "important things," like pretending to work while Googling how tall giraffes are. Spoiler: they’re really tall.

Meanwhile, I sit there, contemplating my existence.

### Evening Drama: The Microwave Incident

Around 5 p.m., the human remembers me. “Oh no, I forgot my coffee!” they gasp. Suddenly, I’m shoved into the microwave. Have you ever been nuked? It’s a nightmare! The spinning, the radiation, the BOILING HOT HANDLE they always forget about—it’s chaos.

### The Final Betrayal: The Sink

When the day ends, do I get a hero’s sendoff? Nope. I’m dumped in the sink with yesterday’s oatmeal bowl. The horror. Do you know what soggy oatmeal feels like? It’s like being hugged by a wet sock.

### The Mug Life: It’s Not Easy Being Ceramic

So next time you reach for your coffee mug, remember: I’m not just a container. I’m a warrior, a survivor, and, dare I say, your best friend.

Now, treat me with respect—or at least rinse me out before the coffee residue becomes a science experiment.
